/**
     * Returns the <i>scheduled</i> execution time of the most recent
     * <i>actual</i> execution of this task.  (If this method is invoked
     * while task execution is in progress, the return value is the scheduled
     * execution time of the ongoing task execution.)
     *
     * <p>This method is typically invoked from within a task's run method, to
     * determine whether the current execution of the task is sufficiently
     * timely to warrant performing the scheduled activity:
     * <pre>
     *   public void run() {
     *       if (System.currentTimeMillis() - scheduledExecutionTime() >=
     *           MAX_TARDINESS)
     *               return;  // Too late; skip this execution.
     *       // Perform the task
     *   }
     * </pre>
     * This method is typically <i>not</i> used in conjunction with
     * <i>fixed-delay execution</i> repeating tasks, as their scheduled
     * execution times are allowed to drift over time, and so are not terribly
     * significant.
     *
     * @return the time at which the most recent execution of this task was
     *         scheduled to occur, in the format returned by Date.getTime().
     *         The return value is undefined if the task has yet to commence
     *         its first execution.
     * @see java.util.Date#getTime()
